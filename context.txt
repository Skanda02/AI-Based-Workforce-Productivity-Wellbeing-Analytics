# Project Context: AI-Based Workforce Productivity & Wellbeing Analytics

## Problem
Healthcare and public sector organizations across the Nordics are facing staff shortages, burnout, and low morale due to aging populations and increasing service demands.
Traditional HR systems only track attendance and leaves — they don’t detect early warning signs of stress, burnout, or workload imbalance.

## Goal
Develop a privacy-respecting AI system that continuously monitors workforce wellbeing indicators using **non-intrusive data from digital work patterns**, detects early burnout risks, and provides **real-time dashboards and recommendations** for managers.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Data Collection Layer (Agents)**: AI agents automatically fetch and preprocess anonymized, aggregated signals from multiple work-related data sources.
- **Analytics & ML Layer**: Central models analyze these signals to detect stress, predict burnout, and recommend preventive interventions.
- **Dashboard Layer**: Interactive manager dashboard for insights, alerts, and recommendations.

## Core Principles
- Privacy-first design: no personal or identifiable content collected.
- All data aggregated and anonymized at source.
- Consent-based integration for each data source.
- Agents operate on company-managed endpoints (not individual devices).
- Modular architecture: each agent runs as a Dockerized microservice.

## Tech Stack (Preferred)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) for APIs + Celery for async tasks
- **ML/Analytics:** PyTorch or TensorFlow + Scikit-learn + Pandas
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS (optional)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series patterns
- **Messaging:** Kafka / RabbitMQ for agent communication

## Agent-Based Data Collection
Each agent is a containerized microservice responsible for collecting and transforming specific types of data.
Agents communicate securely with the central analytics layer via APIs or message queues.

## Agents Overview

### 1. Calendar Agent
Scrapes and summarizes work calendar patterns from Outlook / Google Calendar.
Extracted features:
- Average meeting hours per day
- Number of back-to-back meetings
- Free-time ratio between meetings
- After-hours meeting frequency
- Meeting sentiment (optional, via title text embeddings)
- Meeting load trend week-over-week

### 2. Communication Agent (Email & Chat)
Aggregates metadata (not content) from Outlook, Teams, Slack.
Extracted features:
- Number of emails/messages sent and received
- Response time distribution
- Out-of-hours communication frequency
- Thread length averages (collaboration density)
- Incoming vs outgoing communication ratio
- Silence gaps (periods of non-responsiveness)

### 3. Task & Workflow Agent (Project Management)
Integrates with Jira, Trello, or Asana.
Extracted features:
- Task completion rate
- Average task age
- Overtime tasks vs planned workload
- Workload distribution per employee/team
- Missed vs completed deadlines
- Task-switching frequency

### 4. Attendance & Shift Agent
Pulls anonymized HRIS / time-tracking data.
Extracted features:
- Working hours vs planned hours
- Late arrivals / early exits trend
- Absence frequency
- Shift overlap & imbalance
- Consecutive workdays count

### 5. Device Activity Agent
Collects aggregated system-level telemetry (not keystrokes or personal data).
Extracted features:
- Active computer hours
- Idle time ratio
- Peak working intervals
- Multi-device context switching
- Application-switching frequency (stress indicator)

### 6. Survey & Sentiment Agent
Collects short weekly pulse surveys + optional mood indicators.
Extracted features:
- Mood index
- Stress self-rating
- Engagement delta over time
- Qualitative keyword trend analysis

### 7. Health & Bio Agent (optional, privacy-restricted)
If organization-approved integrations (e.g., Fitbit API)
Extracted features:
- Sleep duration averages
- Resting heart rate variability (HRV)
- Step count / movement patterns
- Work-hour activity correlation

---

## Analytics Layer (Model Inputs)

Each agent outputs normalized features into a unified schema:
- `employee_id` (hashed)
- `timestamp`
- `feature_name`
- `feature_value`

Analytics models use:
- Time-series anomaly detection
- Stress index computation
- Burnout prediction (supervised learning)
- Correlation network between workload and engagement
- Organizational-level dashboards

## Example Insight
> “Team B has experienced a 25% increase in after-hours activity and 30% reduction in meeting-free focus hours over the last two weeks — early burnout risk.”

---

## Deliverables for Copilot
1. Generate modular Python microservices (one per agent) using FastAPI.
2. Add standard Dockerfile for each agent.
3. Use asyncio / Celery tasks for periodic scraping.
4. Push aggregated, anonymized data to central API endpoint or message queue.
5. Implement monitoring and auto-scaling configs (Kubernetes deployments).
6. Build minimal dashboard API for team stress visualization.

---

## Developer Notes
- No direct scraping of message content or private data.
- Agents use OAuth or API tokens to access permitted metadata.
- System should be deployable via Docker Compose or Kubernetes cluster.
- Logs and telemetry anonymized by default.
